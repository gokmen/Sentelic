Sentelic
--------

Sentelic Mouse (Asus UX31) disable daemon while typing.

To run it just type:

 $ sudo ./sentelic.py

If you need something different from its current settings which are:

 - Default timeout is 0.9 sec.
 - Uses dmesg output to find correct device path
   Usually its: /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio4

You can define different ones in /etc/sentelic.conf:

    timeout=1.5
    device=/different/device/path

You may start the daemon in system boot.
